This folder contains the shiny App generated for the clients of the project.

This app, theoretically intended for use by potential college applicants, asks them to fill in relevant personal information and returns a list of schools that we recommend, per a 'quality/goodness-of-fit' score that we painstakingly created. The score dynamically responds to information, such as their income bracket or location, and returns schools that will give a good, affordable education with a large emphasis on enabling and ensuring a successful future.
