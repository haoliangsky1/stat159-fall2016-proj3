# College. Where should I apply? 
###An interactive app to help you decide

## Introduction

This project aims to design and build an interactive website for an NGO in order to provide college applicants, primarily minority, low-income, at-risk students, a responsive portfolio of schools which would best serve their needs: a high-quality, low-cost education.

This repository contains the material for Project 3 of the Fall 2016 edition of Statistics 159 at UC Berkeley by Liang Hao, Bret Hart, Andrew Shibata and Gary Nguyen.

## File Structure

In this repository, you'll find directories which contain different pieces that ultimately come together to make a ShinyApp, a report, and a presentation. 

The *code*/ directory contains:

* *functions*/ for self-defined functions and executable python code;

* *scripts*/ for major R scripts used in the project, including Exploratory Data Analysis, Premodeling, and Data Processing;

* *tests*/ for unit tests verifying the validity the self-defined functions.

* and *shinyApp*/ for the code of the shinyApp.

More information about the code in the project can be found in the respective *README.md* file.

The *data*/ directory theoretically contains the major data set used for this project, which can be installed locally using the makefile. You'll also find the intermediary RData objects created to perform analysis and write the report. More information about the data can be found in the *README.md* file.

The *images*/ directory contains all the images produced and used for exploratory purposes, analysis, the ShinyApp, and the report.

The *report*/ directory contains the *sections* of the report, which can be read, compiled together, in the final report.pdf. 

The *slides*/ directory contains all code used to produce the slides, as well as the slides themselves.

The file structure is listed as following.

## Instructions for Reproduction:

This is a fully open and reproducible project - and to generate the entire thing, only the skeleton of repository is necessary due to automation. All the materials and contents can be generated by executing the *Makefile* macros in a user's local terminal. 

### *Makefile* Commands:

The *Makefile* for this project provides multiple phony targets to streamline the reproduction process, including:

* ```all```: produces the entire project from scratch

* ```data```: downloads the *CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data.zip* file, unzips it to the folder *data*, and cleans it up to produce the five datasets for the past five years as raw data that we use for the project. It will also download the *Most-Recent-Cohorts-Treasury-Elements.csv* dataset and clean it to the *salaryRaw.csv*. Ultimately, it merges the datasets into the *combinedData.csv* which is the primary dataset used for the remainder of the project.

* ```tests```: runs the unit tests for the self-defined functions

* ```eda```: performs exploratory data analysis

* ```report```: generates the *report.pdf* file from the various *sections*

* ```slides```: generates the *slides.html*

* ```shinyApp```: generates the shiny App for this project

* ```session```:  generates the *session-info.txt* file

* ```clean```: delete various generated objects, such as the compiled final report
