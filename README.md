## Introduction

This project aims to design and build a website for an NGO in order to provide minority studetns a portfolio of colleges which would best serve their needs: a high-quality, low-cost education.


And the repository holds the material for Project 3 of the Fall 2016 edition of Statistics 159 at UC Berkeley by Liang Hao, Bret Hart, Andrew Shibata and Gary Nguyen.

## File Structure

This Project Repository contains multiple directories. 

The *code* folder contains:

* *functions* folder for self-defined functions;

* *scripts* folder for major R scripts used to produce the project, including Exploratory Data Analysis, Premodeling Data Processing;

* *tests* folder for the tests for self-defined functions.

* *shinyApp* folder for the creation of the shinyApp for the project.

More information about the codes for the project could be found in the *README.md* file in the *code* folder.

The *data* folder contains the major data set used for this project and all ther intermediate R data that are used to perform analysis and write the report. More information about the data could be found in the *README.md* file in the *data* folder.

The *images* folder contains all the images that are produced and used for analysis and report.

The *report* folder contains the *sections* folder, which stores the report by section, and the report for the analysis.

The *slides* folder contains all materials needed to produce the slides.

The file structure is listed as following.

## Insturction for Reproduction:

To reproduce the project, only the skeleton of repository is necessary. All the materials and contents could be generated by *Makefile*.

### *Makefile* Commands:

The *Makefile* for this project provides multiple phony targets to streamline the reproduction process, including:

* ```all```: produce the entire project from scratch

* ```data```: will download the *CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data.zip* file, unzip it to the folder *data*, and clean it up to produce the five datasets for the past five years, as raw data that we would use for the project. And it will download the *Most-Recent-Cohorts-Treasury-Elements.csv* dataset and clean up to be a *salaryRaw.csv*. And in the end, it would merge the datasets for the *combinedData.csv* as the primary dataset for use.

* ```tests```: will run the unit tests for the self-defined functions

* ```eda```: will perform the exploratory data analysis

* ```report```: will generate the *report.pdf* file

* ```slides```: will generate the *slides.html*

* ```shinyApp```: will generate the shiny App for this project

* ```session```:  will generate the *session-info.txt* file

* ```clean```: will delete the generated report
