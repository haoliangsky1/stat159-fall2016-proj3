# Insturction for Reproduction:

To reproduce the project, only the skeleton of repository is necessary. All the materials and contents could be generated by *Makefile*.

## *Makefile* Commands:

The *Makefile* for this project provides multiple phony targets to streamline the reproduction process, including:

* ```all```: produce the entire project from scratch

* ```data```: will download the *Credit.csv* file to the folder *data*

* ```tests```: will run the unit tests for the self-defined functions

* ```eda```: will perform the exploratory data analysis

* ```report```: will generate the *report.pdf* file

* ```slides```: will generate the *slides.html*

* ```shinyApp```: will generate the shiny App for this project

* ```session```:  will generate the *session-info.txt* file

* ```clean```: will delete the generated report
